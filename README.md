# Test Mile Daksha

Daksha is re-usable Java library for test automation, to be used primarily with TestNG. With minor tweaks, it can be used with any other test engine or custom test automation implementations.

One of the key goals is to provide a practical implementation of advanced PEAL (Page-Element-Automator-Loader) model for UI automation developed by Rahul Verma.
