# Test Mile Daksha

Daksha is re-usable Java library for test automation, to be used primarily with TestNG. With minor tweaks, it can be used with any other test engine or custom test automation implementations.

It includes a practical implementation of PEAL (Page-Element-Automator-Loader) model for UI automation developed by Rahul Verma (www.rahulverma.net). PEAL is an advanced automation model that enables integration of multiple tools, page definition externalization, customized identification types and so on, with finer control of each component. Additionaly, it includes common file readers, process launching, configuration management, generic Value abstraction etc to make test automation development easier.
